				<h2 id="intro">Help!</h2>
				<p class="heading">So you've stumbled across Cinnamon but haven't the faintest clue how to use him. Or perhaps you've just forgotten one or two commands and how to properly use them. Heck, maybe you're just here because you've got nothing better to be doing. Either way, you'll find a full list of every command, its aliases, description, and example usage below :3</p>
				<p class="centerText" style="font-size:12px;margin-bottom:25px"><i>Please note that Cinnamon is still quite far from completion and as such it's possible (though unlikely) that you may run into bugs. If you are ever in a position where Cinnamon displayed unexpected behaviour such as failing to respond to a command, please let me know instead of simply kicking him so that I can fix the problem.</i></p>

				<p class="centerText">There are some sub-commands with the alias <code>' '</code> - this means that if nothing is written after the parent command, this command will be executed by default. For example, <code>c!jm list</code> and simply <code>c!jm</code> will both list the server's welcome messages. When using a role, channel, or user as an argument you can use their ID, tag, or name.<br><b>All textual arguments used in a command (except the last one) must be enclosed with quotation marks if they contain spaces (shown below).</b><br><code>c!ship "Lord Kanelsnegle" John Cena</code></p>

				<h3 id="configuration">Configuration</h3>
				<p class="heading">The following commands are used to configure the bot to your liking so that it can suit your server's needs as perfectly as possible. Every single one of these commands can ONLY be used by the server owner or Cinnamon moderators (the role for this can be set using the `modrole` command).</p>
				
				<h4 id="prefix">prefix</h4>
				<p>Set the bot’s command prefix, no longer than 10 characters.
				<br><code>Usage: prefix &lt;prefix...&gt;</code></p>

				<p style="margin-bottom:16px">Set the channel that you want messages to be sent to when users join or leave the server, as well as information from the latest patch and any important notices. By default the bot will automatically set this to your guild’s welcome channel - if there isn’t one set then it’ll be set to the first channel found with the word “announcement”. If the bot still can’t find a default channel the message channel will be set to the first channel which the bot can send messages to. Set this to <code>off</code> or <code>disable</code> to disable messages all together, though it’s bly recommended that you keep notifications enabled in case of any major changes to Cinnamon’s functionality.
				<br><code>Usage: msgchannel &lt;textChannel...&gt;|off|disable</code></p>

					<p>Add a message to the list of welcome messages that are used to welcome users to your guild when they join; if there is more than one welcome message set, the bot will pick one at random when a user joins.

There is a limit of 15 welcome messages per guild.
					<br><code>Usage: joinmsg add &lt;message...&gt;</code></p>
					
					<h4>delete, del, -, remove</h4>

					<p>Add a message to the list of farewell messages that are used to say goodbye to users in your guild when they leave; if there is more than one farewell message set, the bot will pick one at random when a user leaves. By default the user’s name will be at the beginning of the message, but you can use <code>{user}</code> at any point in your message if you would like to move where their name is, e.g. <code>leavemsg add Farewell {user}!</code> will output <code>Farewell Username#1234!</code> when a user leaves.

				<div class="content">
					
					<h4 style="margin-top:20px">add, +, create</h4>
					<p>Add a role to your guild’s list of automated roles, with an optional condition.</p>
					<p>A timespan can be included so that users are only given the role after they’ve been in the server for a certain amount of time - e.g. <code>autorole add Role 10h</code> will add the role “Role” to users that have been in the server for 10 hours or longer. The bot will only accept timespans in terms of weeks, days, hours, minutes, and seconds.</p>
					<p>Likewise, a message count can be included so that users are only given the role after they’ve sent a certain amount of messages - e.g. <code>autorole add Role 10 messages</code> will add the role “Role” to users that have sent 10 or more messages. When using this condition you MUST include the word “message” or “msg” to specify that it is a message condition and not a timespan.</p>
					<p>If no timespan or message number is supplied then the role will be immediately given to new users as soon as they join the guild.
					<br><code>Usage: autorole add &lt;role...&gt; [timespan|messageCount]</code></p>
