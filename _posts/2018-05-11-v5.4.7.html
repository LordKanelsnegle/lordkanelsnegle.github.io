						<li>Fixed a <b>Connect Four</b> bug preventing users from filling columns fully
						<li>Commands will now no longer execute while the bot is booting, as intended

						<li><b>Connect Four</b> will now only run if the bot has the permissions it needs
						<li><b>remindme</b> messages can now be up to 2000 characters (used to be 100)

						<li>Channel based configuration options have been remade in a better way
						<li>Altered paginated list formats
						<li>Sprinkled with love and affection</li>
