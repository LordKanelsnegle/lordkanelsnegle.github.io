					<h2>Bug Fixes and Adjustments:</h2>
					<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
						<li><b>userinfo</b> now puts a crown on the profile of the server owner</li>
						<li>Fixed a bug where getting the profile of a user with no roles would give an error</li>
						<li>The "Permissions" section of <b>userinfo</b> now works properly (shows the names of the permissions the user has instead of a number)</li>
						<li>Corrected an issue that caused the embed color of the <b>userinfo</b> command to be incorrect (should always be the same colour as the user being displayed)</li>
						<li><b>quote</b> will now delete the message that invoked it (e.g. if you type <b>~quote 2132142412131</b> it'll delete your message then quote the message with the ID that was provided)</li>
						<li>Join and Leave messages now mention the involved user by default, at the beginning of the message</li>
						<li>Maximum message length increased from 50 to 350, excluding <b>{user}</b></li>
						<li><b>joinmsg list</b> and <b>leavemsg list</b> are now paginated (multiple pages which you can use reactions to move through), with 5 messages per page</li>
						<li>Fixed a bug where <b>joinmsg list</b> and <b>leavemsg list</b> showed empty lists</li>
						<li>Solved a problem where users could add the same leave message multiple times</li>
						<li>Corrected an issue in which <b>leavemsg add</b> was causing all kinds of problems if it was the first leave message to be added for a guild</li>
						<li><b>grouphug</b> and <b>battle</b> have been re-enabled</li>
						<li><b>battle</b> messages will now be deleted after the battle is over to prevent the message glitching out and lagging the entire channel</li>
						<li>Sprinkled with love and affection</li>
