					<h2>Bug Fixes and Adjustments:</h2>
					<ul style="list-style-type:disc">

						<li>All game commands which are restricted to the game's creator can now also be used by admins</li>
						<li>Squished a bunch of bugs for the Fortnite API and CAH game mode, as well as improving efficiency</li>
						<li>Added <b>stats</b> as a command alias for <b>info</b></li>
						<li>Fixed a bug that broke the shipping algorithm</li>
						<li>Updated <b>config</b> command and made it look nicer</li>
						<li><b>fortnite profile</b> command now automatically finds the right platform instead of taking it as a parameter</li>
						<li>Fixed <b>waifurate</b> values whcih were set higher than 10 (e.g. 35/10)</li>
						<li>Fixed RNG lock (guarantees randomly picked gifs aren't the same as the last randomly picked thing)</li>
						<li>Farewell messages should now behave as they should instead of sending welcome messages</li>
						<li>Sprinkled with love and affection</li>
