					<h2>Bug Fixes and Adjustments:</h2>
					<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
						<li>Slightly altered the way <b>info</b> and **help</b> embeds are designed</li>
						<li>Fixed a bug in which the bot was a <i>bit</i> too enthusiastic about reminding people and would send reminders after every reboot</li>
						<li><b>remindme</b> command is now accurate to the nearest second instead of the nearest minute, as it should be</li>
						<li>The reminder command should also now correctly display the time set (e.g. <b>2 hours and 5 minutes</b> instead of <b>125 minutes and 0 seconds</b>)</li>
						<li>Time set for the reminder command is now significantly more forgiving (ignores minor spelling mistakes, accepts non-chronological combinations eg. 5h3d2m, etc)</li>
						<li>Removed <b>boot</b>, <b>card</b>, and <b>stomach</b> from insult nouns because they didn't make sense.</li>
						<li>Added <b>fart</b> to insult nouns because I have the humour of a 3rd grader</li>
						<li>Made the <b>daily</b> command prettier</li>
						<li>Fixed a bug that caused the bot to shut down a lot more frequently than it needed to.</li>
						<li>Sprinkled with love and affection</li>
					</ul>
