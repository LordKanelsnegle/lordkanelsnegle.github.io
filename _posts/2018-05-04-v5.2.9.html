					<h2>New Features:</h2>
					<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
						<li><h4 style="margin: 0;">Connect Four (Game Update)</h4>I created an emoji-based, embedded Connect Four game which can be played using reactions as an adaptation of the well-known board game. The general concept is to get four tokens in a line, whether horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Each user starts with a token of a particular colour (indicated by the emoji next to your username) and users take turns dropping one token at a time into the column of their choice.<br>For more information and command usage see the <a href="https://lordkanelsnegle.github.io/commands">commands page</a>.</li>

					<h2>Bug Fixes and Adjustments:</h2>
					<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
						<li>Fixed a bug that caused that hourly and daily message activity not to be recorded</li>
						<li>Removed the <b>logchannel</b> feature and commands because I realised that logging isnt a very unique feature and is already accomplished by many other bots, deeming it unnecessary - plus Audit Logs are a thing now</li>
						<li>Fixed yet another database issue that caused the bot to crash when joining a new guild</li>
						<li>Patched a <b>Cards Against Humanity</b> bug which prevented users from being able to use any game moderation commands like cancelling the game or ending it prematurely</li>
						<li>Sprinkled with love and affection</li>
					</ul>
